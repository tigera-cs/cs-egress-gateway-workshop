# Lesson -  Introduction

As more organizations embrace containerization and adopt Kubernetes, they reap the benefits of platform scalability, application portability, and optimized infrastructure utilization. However, with this shift comes a new set of security challenges related to enabling connectivity for applications in heterogeneous environments.

In this blog post, we'll explore a real-life scenario of security exposure resulting from egress traffic leaving the Kubernetes cluster. We'll examine how the Calico Egress Gateway can help mitigate these issues by providing robust access control. By using Calico Egress Gateway, enterprises can secure communication from their Kubernetes workloads to the internet, 3rd party applications and networks while maintaining a high level of security.

The Calico Egress Gateway enforces security policies to regulate traffic flowing out of the Kubernetes cluster, providing granular control over egress traffic. This ensures that only authorized traffic is allowed to leave the cluster, mitigating the risks associated with unauthorized outbound traffic.
